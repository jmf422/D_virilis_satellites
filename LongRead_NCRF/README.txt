# README.txt 

 Scripts in this folder were used to analyze satellites using the program Noise-Cancelling Repeat Finder (https://github.com/makovalab-psu/NoiseCancellingRepeatFinder)

1) NCRF_species25.sh shows how we implemented NCRF to quantify satellites of interest in raw long reads. 

2) NCRF_virilis_strand.sh shows our strand estimates (we used this in addition to looking at the summary files produced by NCRF as validation). This called on helper script: which_strand_pacbio_script.sh.
