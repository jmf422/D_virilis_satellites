The files in this folder contain scripts used to analyze the genome assemblies.  
-phobos_assembly_species.sh uses PHOBOS to characterize simple satellites in the genome assemblies  
-get_contiglengths.sh calculates the length of each contig in the fasta file  
-The ComplexRepeats directory uses TandemRepeatsFinder to find complex satellites in the assembly and also includes scripts used to analyze complex satellites in the raw long reads.  
-Rmarkdown file processes the results and displays them
